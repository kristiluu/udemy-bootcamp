        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

        <div class="post">
            <p class="blockquote"><em>JOSH IS MARGOT’S BOYFRIEND, BUT </em>I guess you could say my whole family is a little in
                    love with him. It’s hard to say who most of all. Before he was Margot’s boyfriend, he was
                    just Josh. He was always there. I say always, but I guess that’s not true. He moved next
                    door five years ago but it feels like always.</p>
            <p>My dad loves Josh because he’s a boy and my dad is surrounded by girls. I mean it: all
                    day long he is surrounded by females. My dad is an ob-gyn, and he also happens to be
                    the father of three daughters, so it’s like girls, girls, girls all day. He also likes Josh
                    because Josh likes comics and he’ll go fishing with him. My dad tried to take us fishing
                    once, and I cried when my shoes got mud on them, and Margot cried when her book got
                    wet, and Kitty cried because Kitty was still practically a baby.</p>
            <p>Kitty loves Josh because he’ll play cards with her and not get bored. Or at least
                    pretend to not get bored. They make deals with each other—if I win this next hand, you
                    have to make me a toasted crunchy-peanut-butter-sandwich, no crusts. That’s Kitty.
                    Inevitably there won’t be crunchy peanut butter and Josh will say too bad, pick something
                    else. But then Kitty will wear him down and he’ll run out and buy some, because that’s
                    Josh.

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

        <div class="post">
            <p class="blockquote"><em>THE NEXT MORNING, MARGOT IS</em> making coffee and I am pouring cereal in bowls, and I
                    say the thing I’ve been thinking all morning. “Just so you know, Daddy and Kitty are
                    going to be really upset.” When Kitty and I were brushing our teeth just now, I was
                    tempted to go ahead and spill the beans, but Kitty was still mad at me from yesterday, so
                    I kept quiet. She didn’t even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them
                    because all that was left on the plate were crumbs.</p>
            <p>Margot lets out a heavy sigh. “So I’m supposed to stay with Josh because of you and
                    Daddy and Kitty?”
                    “No, I’m just telling you.”
                    “It’s not like he would come over here that much once I was gone, anyway.”</p>
            <p>I frown. This didn’t occur to me, that Josh would stop coming over because Margot was
                    gone. He was coming over long before they were ever a couple, so I don’t see why he
                    should stop. “He might,” I say. “He really loves Kitty.”</p>
